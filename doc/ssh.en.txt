Commands at remote hosts are invoked through OpenSSH.  A local command
can be injected before the first invocation of OpenSSH, by setting the
"ssh.pre_command" configuration option to your user configuration file
(~/.cinnamon/config.json), e.g.:

  {
    "ssh.pre_command": "keychain --timeout 30 ~/.ssh/id_rsa"
  }
